# Newton Activity Detection (Batch Text Generation)

Create and monitor asynchronous batch jobs that run the **Newton C language model** against a JSONL prompt file. Each line in the input is an `InferenceRecord` (`system` + `instruction` + `prompt` + optional `inputs` array); each line in the output is `{"line_index": N, "prediction": "..."}`. The pipeline is named `activity-detection` on the platform.

The streaming/synchronous counterpart is [`newton-query-prompting`](../newton-query-prompting/SKILL.md) — same C model, different orchestration. Use this skill when you need to fold thousands-to-millions of prompts asynchronously; use `/query` when you have one state snapshot and need an answer in 3–6 s.

Worked end-to-end example, including the full MapReduce code: [**archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot**](https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot) — 1 GB of synthetic WiFi flow CSV (5.8 M flows across 24 devices × 24 hours) folded into 9 daily narratives via six reduce stages. The numbers and pattern depths quoted below come from that pipeline; the patterns are model- and dataset-independent — only the depth of the hierarchy changes with the cliff value.

## When to Apply

- User wants Newton to write per-row / per-record narratives over a large dataset (logs, flows, events) where the input is too big or too numerous for `/query`.
- User wants to fold many small inputs into one summary via MapReduce / hierarchical reduce.
- User is hitting silent quality degradation on long prompts and isn't sure why ("status COMPLETED, predictions are garbage").
- User is chaining reduce stages and getting cross-scope leakage in the final narratives.

## Pipeline shape

```
Pipeline key:   activity-detection
Input port:     worker.data        (one JSONL file; each line = InferenceRecord)
Output:         outputs/pred_*.jsonl
                  one JSON per line: {"line_index": N, "prediction": "..."}
```

### Input record schema

```json
{
  "system": "You are a network security analyst reviewing smart-home WiFi traffic...",
  "instruction": "Analyze the attached flow log and describe what happened on this day. Summarize activity level, dominant protocols, temporal patterns, most-active device, and flag anything unusual.",
  "prompt": "Date: 2019-10-19 UTC. Scope: home wlan0 interface. Flow count: 78.",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "format": "plain",
      "data": "Flow log fields (pipe-separated): time_utc|mac_a|mac_b|prot|tran|port_a|port_b|bytes_a|bytes_b|pkts_a|pkts_b. Transport: 6=TCP, 17=UDP, 1=ICMP.\n\n15:55:11|ebd1a7fa8544|e323b826aa71|DHCP|17|67|68|0|900|0|3\n15:55:14|e323b826aa71|13d35af5c06b|DHCP|17|68|67|900|0|3|0\n..."
    }
  ]
}
```

The **question** goes in `prompt`, the **evidence** goes in `inputs[0].data`. The `inputs` array is the InferenceRecord schema's contract for extra context. Full schema: [Nano Inference input format](https://github.com/archetypeai/atai_core/tree/main/services/jos_service/nano_inference#input-format).

### Input types supported by `inputs[]`

Per the platform's validation error message when the wrong shape is submitted:

```
Expected JSONL with fields: system?, instruction?, prompt?,
  inputs?: [{type: text|image|video, format: base64|plain, data, extra?}]
```

So each item in `inputs[]` is `{type, format, data}`. Note that **`file_id`
is NOT accepted here** — bytes must be embedded inline.

| `type`  | `format` | `data` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text`  | `plain`  | Raw text (CSV rows, flow logs, prose context) | Default for structured-data MapReduce — see the ghost-iot example below. |
| `image` | `base64` | Base64-encoded JPEG/PNG bytes | One or more frames sampled from a video, screen captures, dashboard renders. |
| `video` | `base64` | Base64-encoded MP4 bytes | The pipeline samples up to `max_video_frames` (default 32) frames internally. Verified against `newton/c:2.5.1-8b-base` (vision-only, no audio); model variants with audio may behave differently. |

Vision example record (one 90 s MP4 chunk per record):

```json
{
  "system": "You are analyzing a procedural video. Produce a written step-by-step guide based only on what is visible.",
  "instruction": "Create a step-by-step procedural guide for the work shown in this video segment.",
  "prompt": "Source: machine_repair.mp4, segment 0-90s (chunk_index=0).",
  "inputs": [
    {"type": "video", "format": "base64", "data": "<base64-encoded MP4 bytes ~25–35 MB per 90 s @ 1080p>"}
  ]
}
```

Image-mode equivalent (N stills, no video decode):

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {"type": "image", "format": "base64", "data": "<base64 JPEG>"},
    {"type": "image", "format": "base64", "data": "<base64 JPEG>"},
    {"type": "image", "format": "base64", "data": "<base64 JPEG>"}
  ]
}
```

### Uploading the JSONL for vision-heavy records

A multi-record JSONL with base64-embedded videos quickly grows past 100 MB
(eight 90 s 1080p chunks ≈ 240 MB). The simple `POST /files` endpoint
**rejects `application/x-ndjson`** at its multipart-form validator (despite
listing it in the supported-types error message — known platform
inconsistency). Use the 3-step **presigned multipart flow** for the JSONL:

```
POST /v0.5/files/uploads/initiate  { filename, file_type: "application/x-ndjson", num_bytes }
PUT   <presigned-url>              <part-bytes>   (one PUT per part)
POST /v0.5/files/uploads/{upload_id}/complete  { parts: [...] }
```

See [`newton-batch-upload`](../newton-batch-upload/SKILL.md) for the full
flow. Frame uploads to `/files` (image/jpeg, video/mp4) work fine via the
simple endpoint — only `application/x-ndjson` needs the multipart path.

## Creating a Batch Job

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/batch/jobs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ATAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-narrative-job",
    "pipeline_type": "batch",
    "pipeline_key": "activity-detection",
    "inputs": {
      "worker.data": [{"file_id": "my_prompts.jsonl"}]
    },
    "parameters": {
      "worker": {
        "parallelism": 1,
        "config": {
          "generation": {
            "do_sample": true,
            "max_new_tokens": 1024,
            "repetition_penalty": 1,
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "top_k": 20,
            "top_p": 0.8
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Response: `{"id": "job_...", "status": "PENDING", ...}`. The standard lifecycle is `PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED / FAILED / CANCELLED`.

### Generation knobs

| Knob | Typical | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `max_new_tokens` | 512–1024 (text), 2048–4096 (vision) | Newton truncates mid-sentence at the cap. Size for your longest expected narrative + ~20 % headroom. |
| `temperature` | 0.5–0.8 | Lower = more consistent across reduce passes (useful when you'll concatenate predictions back). |
| `do_sample` | `true` | `false` gives greedy decoding — sometimes useful for deterministic fold stages. |
| `top_k` / `top_p` | 20 / 0.8 | Defaults match `/query`. Rarely worth tuning unless you see repetition. |

### Worker-config knobs (siblings of `generation`)

Visible in the platform Batch Manager UI; confirmed from the GET
`/batch/jobs/{id}` response. All live under `parameters.worker.config`:

| Knob | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model_variant` | `newton/c:2.5.1-8b-base` (today) | Override to pin a specific model build. Whether other variants are exposed depends on your org. |
| `max_video_frames` | `32` | How many frames the pipeline samples from a `type: "video"` input. Higher = denser visual coverage but pushes you toward the per-record token budget; lower = leaner records, faster inference, less faithful procedure recall. |
| `batch_size` | auto-escalates to 16–24 | **Pin to `1` for media-heavy records.** The engine auto-escalates and `OOMKilled`s the pod when records (~30 MB base64 video) exceed VRAM. Same lesson the [ghost-iot CSV cliff](https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot#reason-2-csv-heavy-quality-cliff-no-warning-silent-garbage) flagged in a different shape. |
| `parallelism` | `1` | Multi-worker not currently supported. Get parallelism by submitting N independent jobs. |

## Monitoring & Outputs

```bash
# Poll status
curl -s "$BASE_URL/batch/jobs/$JOB_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ATAI_API_KEY"

# Events / logs
curl -s "$BASE_URL/batch/jobs/$JOB_ID/events" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ATAI_API_KEY"

# List output artifacts (paginated, presigned S3 URLs, 1-hour expiry)
curl -s "$BASE_URL/batch/jobs/$JOB_ID/outputs?limit=50&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ATAI_API_KEY"

# Download an artifact (no auth — signature is in the URL)
curl -s -o pred_0.jsonl "$PRESIGNED_URL"
```

Output line:

```json
{"line_index": 0, "prediction": "On 2019-10-19 the home wlan0 interface saw 78 flows..."}
```

On per-record failure:

```json
{"line_index": 5, "prediction": null, "error": "parse error"}
```

`"parse error"` almost always means **the input wasn't JSONL** (raw CSV submitted by mistake, or a stray blank line). The job itself still returns `COMPLETED`.

## The Quality Cliff (read this before designing anything)

The Newton C model has a **nominal context budget of 16,384 tokens** but a much tighter **practical quality cliff at ~4K tokens (~16 KB of pipe-separated structured rows)**. Above the cliff the model silently degrades into table-completion mode and returns 1–3-character fragments like `'00'`, `'|153|'`, or empty strings.

**The failure is silent.** No `WARN` event, no `FAILED` status. The job reports `Status: COMPLETED`, `0 failed`. The only signal is reading the predictions themselves.

Empirical cliff sweep on CSV-heavy `inputs[0].data` (from the [ghost-iot worked example](https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot), §10.6 of the README):

| `inputs[0].data` size | ~Tokens | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 10.4 KB | ~2.5K | Real narratives ✓ |
| **16.5 KB** | **~4K** | **Real narratives ✓ (last good)** |
| 20.6 KB | ~5K | ✗ Garbage fragments |
| 41.1 KB | ~10K | ✗ Garbage + truncation warning fires |

The cliff and the nominal context window are **independent failure modes**. The model can ingest the tokens and emit plausible-sized output — it just can't synthesize narrative from that much structured data at once.

### Cliff sweep methodology

Before designing a multi-day pipeline, spend 30 minutes establishing the cliff for *your* model + *your* input shape:

1. Take 5 representative records.
2. Build 4 variants per record, capped at 10 KB / 16 KB / 20 KB / 40 KB of `inputs[0].data`.
3. Submit all 20 as a single batch job.
4. Read every prediction. The cliff is the largest cap where all 5 still produce real narratives.

**Revalidate per model and per input shape.** A model with a larger nominal context window doesn't automatically have a higher cliff — CSV-heavy structured input degrades earlier than prose. Newton 2.5.1, Gemma, Claude, GPT-4o will all have different cliffs.

## MapReduce / Hierarchical Reduce

Once you know the cliff, every reduce stage in a pipeline answers the same question:

> Does the concatenation of N inputs at this stage fit under the cliff?

- **Yes** → single-pass reduce works.
- **No** → insert a hierarchical pre-fold (group N inputs into packs of K, reduce each pack into a super-input, then fold super-inputs).

### Worked shape — folding 1 GB of CSV into 9 narratives

From the [ghost-iot worked example](https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot), §8 of the README — observed across one end-to-end run on the C 2.4 model (1 GB of WiFi flow CSV, 5.8 M flows across 24 devices × 24 hours, multi-tenant topology of 3 homes × 2 humans × 4 devices/human):

```
chunks (≤16 KB each, every flow preserved) → bucket reduce
  ├─ obvious: fold all chunks of a (device, hour) bucket → ✗ overflows for ~all buckets
  └─ hierarchical:
       Stage A:   chunks → partials       (groups of K=3 chunks per partial)
       Stage A₂:  partials → super-partials (groups of K=4 partials per super) — needed because Stage A's
                                              busy buckets had up to 44 partials = ~44 KB concat
       Stage B:   super-partials → 1 narrative per (device, hour) ✓

hourly narratives → device-day reduce
  ├─ obvious: fold 24 hours per device → ✗ overflows for the busiest device (17.8 KB)
  └─ hierarchical:
       Stage A:   hours → super-hours (groups of K=4 hours per super-hour)
       Stage B:   super-hours → 1 narrative per device ✓

device-day narratives → user-day / house-day reduce
  └─ single-pass:  3 / 8 inputs per group, fits → ✓
```

Six reduce passes total, folding 23,249 chunks down to 9 final narratives. The hierarchical layers exist because the cliff is ~16 KB; **a model with a higher cliff lets you collapse layers**, not change the pattern.

### The shape, restated

```python
# Pseudo-code for one hierarchical reduce pass.
# Inputs: list of N narratives (from a prior stage)
# Output: list of ceil(N/K) super-narratives

# Stage A: pack the inputs into groups of K and submit as a batch job
groups = [inputs[i:i+K] for i in range(0, len(inputs), K)]
for group_index, group in enumerate(groups):
    record = {
        "system":      SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        "instruction": "Summarize the following K narratives into one super-summary.",
        "prompt":      f"super-group {group_index}, K={len(group)}",
        "inputs":      [{"type": "text", "format": "plain",
                         "data":  "\n\n---\n\n".join(group)}],
    }
    emit_jsonl(record)

# Validate the cliff: max(len(record["inputs"][0]["data"])) must be < CLIFF_BYTES
# If it isn't, decrease K and re-pack.
```

Pick `K` so the worst-case packed size sits comfortably below the cliff. The ghost-iot pipeline settled at `K=3` for chunks→partials and `K=4` for the higher layers.

## N-way Batch Split (concurrency, optional)

Most orgs have batch concurrency ≥ 1. If yours has N > 1 slots, every stage can run N batch jobs in parallel, cutting wall-clock by ~N× **with no quality cost**. The recipe:

1. Build the per-stage JSONL as a single ordered file (`combined.jsonl`). **Do not shuffle.**
2. Split it positionally into N contiguous halves: `combined_p1.jsonl`, ..., `combined_pN.jsonl`.
3. Upload all N (see [`newton-batch-upload`](../newton-batch-upload/SKILL.md) if any half exceeds 255 MB).
4. Submit N batch jobs in parallel, one per half.
5. After all complete, concatenate the prediction files **in the same positional order** and renumber `line_index` sequentially (see next section).

Skip the split if N=1 (single-slot org). Use whatever N your org allows — the pattern is the same.

**Why positional, not random:** the join from predictions back to the source manifest depends on either index or content. Random shuffle destroys index alignment and complicates content-key reconstruction (see §"Two silent join bugs" below).

## Two silent join bugs when chaining reduce stages

Both bugs produce zero errors and zero warnings — `COMPLETED` status, plausible-looking but wrong narratives. **Always inspect at least one final narrative against its manifest scope** before trusting the pipeline.

### Bug 1 — Position-based join after shuffle

If you `shuf` the master JSONL before splitting, each output prediction's `line_index` is relative to the *shuffled* input, not the original manifest. A position-based join `predictions[i] → manifest[i]` quietly maps every prediction to the wrong scope (wrong device, wrong hour, wrong home).

**Symptom:** cross-scope leakage in final narratives — Home A's narrative cites devices from Home B.

**Fix — content-key join.** For every reduce stage that needs to know what each prediction is *about*, encode the identifying tuple inside the prompt text and extract it back from the prediction record:

```python
# At prep time, embed the key in the prompt:
prompt = (f"Scope: device={device_id}, hour={hour}, n_flows={n_flows}, "
          f"ts_lo={ts_lo}, ts_hi={ts_hi}, n_bytes={n_bytes}")

# After predictions arrive, extract the key from the original prompt text
# and join to the manifest by (device_id, hour, n_flows, ts_lo, ts_hi, n_bytes).
# This is bulletproof under shuffle, split, retry, or any reordering.
```

A content key is essentially free to compute and survives every reordering. Use it.

### Bug 2 — `line_index` collisions after concat-of-splits

Each split batch job emits predictions with `line_index` relative to *its own* input file (`0..N/2-1` for a half-split). Cat'ing the halves produces **duplicate** `line_index` values.

If any downstream prep script loads predictions into a `dict[line_index] → prediction` and looks up by `line_index`, dict insertion order means the last-loaded value wins:

- Manifest entries with `line_index 0..N/2-1` → silently get the *second half's* predictions (wrong scope).
- Manifest entries with `line_index N/2..N-1` → silently get **no prediction at all** (empty string).

**Symptom:** the next reduce stage describes "no activity" for scopes that should be busy.

**Fix — renumber `line_index` sequentially to `0..N-1` after every concat**, before passing predictions to the next stage's prep script. Five lines of Python:

```python
import json, sys
for new_idx, line in enumerate(sys.stdin):
    rec = json.loads(line)
    rec["line_index"] = new_idx
    print(json.dumps(rec))
```

Run this after every `cat split_*.jsonl`. Skipping it silently breaks the next reduce stage.

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Every prediction is `null` with `"error": "parse error"` | Input is not JSONL (raw CSV, blank lines, trailing comma) | Re-emit the file with one `json.dumps(record)` per line and no blank lines |
| `COMPLETED`, predictions are 1–3-char fragments like `'00'`, `'|153|'`, `''` | `inputs[0].data` is above the model's quality cliff (~4K tokens / ~16 KB for Newton C 2.4) | Run a cliff sweep, then insert a hierarchical pre-fold so every record stays under the cliff |
| `COMPLETED`, final narratives reference the wrong scope | Position-based join after shuffle/split (Bug 1) | Switch to content-key join (encode identifying tuple in `prompt`) |
| `COMPLETED`, half the manifest reports "no activity" | `line_index` collisions after concat-of-splits (Bug 2) | Renumber `line_index` sequentially after every concat |
| `Failed to resolve file inputs` | File not uploaded | Upload first via [`newton-batch-upload`](../newton-batch-upload/SKILL.md) |
| `Pipeline 'X' has no active versions` | Pipeline key wrong for this environment | Verify `pipeline_key` is `activity-detection` and that your org has it deployed |
| `validation errors for InferenceRecord — inputs.0.format Field required` | An `inputs[]` item used `file_id` instead of inline bytes | Use `{type, format: "base64", data: <b64-bytes>}` — `inputs[]` does not accept file_id references |
| Upload returns `Unsupported file type: application/x-ndjson` | JSONL submitted via simple `POST /files` multipart-form | Switch to the 3-step presigned flow (`/files/uploads/initiate` → S3 `PUT` → `/complete`). See [`newton-batch-upload`](../newton-batch-upload/SKILL.md) |
| `WARN inference.truncation … 1 items exceed token_budget=16384` on video records | Per-record token budget exceeded (e.g. 32 video frames + procedure prompt) | Often coped with — read predictions before reacting. To eliminate: reduce `max_video_frames`, shorten the prompt, or split the video into smaller chunks |

## Best Practices

- **Run a cliff sweep first.** 30 minutes of testing 5 records × 4 size caps pays for itself many times over — the whole architecture follows from that single number.
- **Default to hierarchical reduce when N inputs × per-input size approaches the cliff.** Same shape at every level (group K → super → fold).
- **Content-key joins, always.** Position-based joins look fine until the first shuffle or retry and then break silently. Encode `(scope_id, count, time_range, ...)` in `prompt` and parse it back.
- **Renumber `line_index` after every concat.** Five-line Python loop. Skipping it silently breaks the next stage.
- **Inspect at least one final narrative against its manifest scope.** Events log is not enough — both silent failure modes (cliff, joins) produce `COMPLETED` with bad content.
- **Use lower `temperature` (0.5–0.6) for intermediate fold stages.** Variance compounds across reduce passes; tighter sampling at the bottom keeps the final narrative coherent.
- **Split positionally for concurrency, never randomly.** Random shuffle complicates content-key reconstruction and gains nothing.
- **The hierarchy depth follows from the cliff, not the nominal context window.** A model with a higher cliff lets you collapse layers; same pattern, less depth.

## Example Code

### Text MapReduce — `archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot`

[**archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot**](https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot) — full public end-to-end pipeline for the `activity-detection` batch flow: data prep → upload → batch jobs → outputs → join → view, in Python, shell, and curl. Covers both the **simple single-record pattern** (§2–6 of the README — one prompt summarizing a whole filtered day) and the **multi-home MapReduce pattern at GB scale** (§8 — 23 K chunks → six reduce stages → 9 daily narratives). Has the cliff-sweep methodology (§8.2 / §10.6), content-key join (§10.7), `line_index` renumbering (§10.8), and observed wall-clock across all stages.

The orchestration code is pipeline-agnostic — `upload_multipart.py`, the polling loop, and the paginated outputs download transfer unchanged to any other `pipeline_key`. Only the prep scripts (which build the per-stage JSONL) are activity-detection-specific.

See also [`EXPERIENCE.md`](https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-batch-examples-ghost-iot/blob/main/EXPERIENCE.md) in that repo — long-form writeup of *why* the design ended up needing six MapReduce stages instead of one fold.

### Video + image batch — `manual-gen-amat-jos`

[**manual-gen-amat-jos**](https://github.com/archetypeai/manual-gen-amat-jos) — production-style app that runs the `activity-detection` pipeline with `type: "video"` inputs to extract procedural step-by-step manuals from instructional MP4s. End-to-end:

- Chunks a source MP4 into 90 s segments (ffmpeg)
- Builds an N-record JSONL with each segment base64-embedded in `inputs[0].data`
- Uploads the JSONL via the multipart-presigned flow (required for `application/x-ndjson`)
- Submits one batch job with `batch_size: 1`, `max_video_frames: 32`
- Polls, downloads per-segment predictions, parses `[MM:SS]`-anchored steps, dedups, exports to PDF

Has standalone probes (`probe_batch_video.py`, `concurrency_probe.py`) that document the schema corrections this SKILL incorporates — useful as a reference for any new app integrating the batch flow with vision inputs. The repo's [`ARCHETYPE_INTEGRATION.md`](https://github.com/archetypeai/manual-gen-amat-jos/blob/main/ARCHETYPE_INTEGRATION.md) §4 walks the platform error messages → schema corrections journey.
