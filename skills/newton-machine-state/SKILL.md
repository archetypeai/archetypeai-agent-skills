# Newton Machine State Lens

Classify time-series sensor data using n-shot learning. The Machine State Lens uses labeled CSV examples (focus files) to classify new data streams via KNN over sliding windows.

## When to Apply

- User wants to classify sensor data into discrete states
- User asks about anomaly detection or state monitoring
- User wants n-shot classification without training a model
- User is building a real-time monitoring dashboard with status indicators
- User references HRV stress detection or OBD2 vehicle health patterns

## Core Concepts

### N-Shot Classification

Provide labeled CSV examples (focus files) — one per class — and Newton classifies new data against those examples. No model training required.

### Sliding Windows

Newton processes CSV data in overlapping windows:
- **window_size**: Number of rows per window (default: 16)
- **step_size**: Rows to advance between windows (default: 8)
- Expected windows = `floor((dataPoints - windowSize) / stepSize) + 1`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Focus CSVs

Create one CSV per class with labeled sensor data. Each CSV should have:
- Consistent column names matching your data stream
- A representative sample of that class (50-200 rows recommended)
- No header row mismatches between focus files and query data

**Normalize before uploading if your sensors aren't already on comparable scales.** The deployed encoder runs with `normalize_input=False` and the flag is not currently exposed in the Lens config — so what you upload is what the encoder sees. If focus files and query data come from different operating conditions with different bulk amplitudes (e.g. noisy vs clean recordings, low-load vs high-load runs), the encoder reads the amplitude offset as a class signal and cross-condition accuracy collapses even when within-condition is ≥90%. Either z-score each CSV per-channel before upload, or fit a global `StandardScaler` on your focus pool and apply it to both focus and query data. See the matching [Input normalization](../newton-machine-state-batch/SKILL.md#input-normalization) section in the batch skill for the longer discussion; the local-only `normalize_input` flag and the two-option framing are documented in [omega-local/SKILL.md](../omega-local/SKILL.md#normalization-choices).

**Example: HRV Stress Detection**
```
# focus_relaxed.csv
rmssd,sdnn,mean_hr,pnn50,sd1
42.5,45.2,68.3,22.1,30.1
...

# focus_stressed.csv
rmssd,sdnn,mean_hr,pnn50,sd1
18.2,22.1,95.7,8.3,12.9
...
```

**Example: Vehicle Health Monitoring**
```
# focus_normal.csv
rpm,speed,coolant_temp,iat,engine_load,throttle,map
800,0,90,35,18,12,34
...

# focus_attention.csv
rpm,speed,coolant_temp,iat,engine_load,throttle,map
850,0,108,52,45,18,42
...
```

### Step 2: Upload Focus Files (One-Time)

```typescript
async function uploadFile(filePath: string, content: string): Promise<string> {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", new Blob([content], { type: "text/csv" }), filePath);

  const response = await newtonFetch("/files", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData,
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.file_id;
}
```

Cache the returned `file_id` values — focus files only need to be uploaded once per session.

### Step 3: Create a Session

```typescript
const response = await newtonFetch("/lens/sessions/create", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ lens_id: "lns-1d519091822706e2-bc108andqxf8b4os" }),
});
const { session_id } = await response.json();
```

### Step 4: Configure Session with Focus Files

Send a `session.modify` event with n-shot focus file IDs and CSV config:

```typescript
await newtonFetch("/lens/sessions/events/process", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    session_id,
    events: [{
      kind: "session.modify",
      payload: {
        input_n_shot: [
          { label: "relaxed", file_id: relaxedFileId },
          { label: "stressed", file_id: stressedFileId },
        ],
        csv_configs: {
          window_size: 16,
          step_size: 8,
        },
      },
    }],
  }),
});
```

### Step 5: Connect SSE Consumer (Before Input!)

**Critical:** Always connect the SSE consumer before setting the input stream to avoid missing results.

```typescript
const sseResponse = await newtonFetch(
  `/lens/sessions/consumer/${sessionId}`,
  { headers: { Accept: "text/event-stream" } }
);
```

### Step 6: Set Input Stream

Upload query CSV and set as input:

```typescript
const queryFileId = await uploadFile("query.csv", csvContent);

await newtonFetch("/lens/sessions/events/process", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    session_id: sessionId,
    events: [{
      kind: "input_stream.set",
      payload: {
        streams: [{
          id: "input-0",
          source: { type: "csv_file_reader", file_id: queryFileId },
        }],
      },
    }],
  }),
});
```

### Step 7: Parse SSE Results

Each `inference.result` event contains a classification for one window:

```typescript
// SSE event data shape
{
  "kind": "inference.result",
  "payload": {
    "result": ["stressed", { "stressed": 0.85, "relaxed": 0.15 }]
  }
}
```

Aggregate across windows — majority vote or average scores:

```typescript
function aggregateResults(results: Array<[string, Record<string, number>]>) {
  const totals: Record<string, number> = {};
  for (const [label, scores] of results) {
    for (const [key, score] of Object.entries(scores)) {
      totals[key] = (totals[key] || 0) + score;
    }
  }
  const count = results.length;
  return Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(totals).map(([k, v]) => [k, v / count])
  );
}
```

### Step 8: Early SSE Termination (Optimization)

Calculate expected window count and close the stream early instead of waiting for the idle timeout (60-80s):

```typescript
const expectedWindows = Math.floor((dataPoints - windowSize) / stepSize) + 1;
let receivedWindows = 0;

// In SSE parse loop:
if (++receivedWindows >= expectedWindows) {
  reader.cancel(); // Close early
}
```

## Session Lifecycle

```
Upload Focus CSVs (once) → Create Session (once) → [Query Loop: Upload CSV → Set Input → Read SSE Results] → Destroy Session
```

Sessions are reusable — create once, query many times. Only recreate on error.

### Cleanup

```typescript
// Destroy session
await newtonFetch("/lens/sessions/destroy", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ session_id: sessionId }),
});

// Delete uploaded files
await newtonFetch(`/files/delete/${fileId}`, { method: "DELETE" });
```

## NewtonStreamManager Singleton Pattern

For real-time applications, implement a server-side singleton that:

1. Buffers incoming sensor data (max ~300 points)
2. Runs periodic queries every 15 seconds
3. Manages session lifecycle (create on first query, reuse, recreate on error)
4. Pushes results to frontend via SSE

See [references/stream-manager-pattern.md](references/stream-manager-pattern.md) for the full implementation pattern.

## Parallel Per-Subsystem Sessions

A single shared session produces one verdict for the whole system. If you need to know *which* subsystem saw the anomaly — to route alerts, rank severity, or drive per-component UI — run **N parallel sessions, one per subsystem, each over a column subset of the same wide CSV**.

Canonical shape: the subsystems share the same n-shot focus files (`swat_normal.csv` / `swat_attack.csv`) but each lens registers with a different `data_columns` filter — P1's session sees `FIT101/LIT101/MV101/P101`, P3's session sees its nine UF columns, and so on. Six classifiers, one problem, six per-subsystem verdicts per window.

```js
// Per-stage lens register — same n-shot files, different column subset
{
  lens_name: `swat-stage-${stageId}-${ts}`,
  model_pipeline: [{ processor_name: 'lens_timeseries_state_processor' }],
  model_parameters: {
    model_name: 'OmegaEncoder',
    model_version: 'OmegaEncoder::omega_embeddings_1_4',
    buffer_size: 30,
    input_n_shot: { NORMAL: normalFileId, ATTACK: attackFileId },
    csv_configs: {
      data_columns: STAGE_COLUMNS[stageId],  // <-- only this stage's sensors
      window_size: 30,
      step_size: 30
    },
    knn_configs: { n_neighbors: 3, metric: 'euclidean' }
  }
}
```

`omega_embeddings_1_4` is the current default encoder version for Machine State. Other Omega encoder versions may be available on your account (newer builds, domain-specialized variants) — check with your Newton API contact for the current list, then swap the `model_version` string accordingly.

Streaming per window fans out too — transpose the current window to channel-first (`[[col1 values], [col2 values], ...]`, not row-major) and `POST /lens/sessions/events/process` to each session in parallel. On the consumer side the browser opens N concurrent `EventSource` connections (one per session) and bucket-sorts incoming `inference.result` events by session ID to update per-subsystem state.

**When to prefer N parallel sessions over 1 shared session:**
- You need component-level verdicts (to color a plant schematic, page a specific oncall rotation, surface per-area suggestions)
- Sensors are naturally grouped by subsystem, with limited cross-group interaction
- 6× the session-create calls at startup is acceptable (`Promise.all` makes it ~1.5s instead of 9s sequential)

**When the singleton pattern is better:**
- You only care about a single "is the system OK" verdict
- Subsystems are tightly coupled and the anomaly is usually observable from any sensor
- Session count matters for cost (most Newton pricing bills by inference count, not session count — but verify for your account)

See [references/parallel-subsystem-pattern.md](references/parallel-subsystem-pattern.md) for the full pattern, including browser-side cleanup on tab close.

## Multi-Sensor N-Shot (Single Lens, 4 Variates)

Different from parallel-subsystem (N lenses, one per column subset). Here you have **N sibling channels** all watching the same subsystem during the same incident, and you want to use up to 4 of their primary measurements as the **4 variates of a single lens**. Common in benchmarks where each "channel" is one sensor's `.npy` file rather than one column of a wide CSV — e.g. NASA telemanom, where SMAP-E means 13 separate `.npy` files (E-1 through E-13) sampled during the same electrical incident.

Pattern (reference: [`newton-nasa-jpl-telemanom-demo`](https://github.com/archetypeai/newton-nasa-jpl-telemanom-demo)):

1. **Pick up to 4 sibling channels** (per-docs hard cap on variates). Rank by anomaly coverage or by mutual information against the union label.
2. **Truncate to the shortest channel** — sibling channels are typically extracted with slightly different lengths. Use min-length as the common timeline.
3. **Assume row-index alignment** — within a sibling group, anomaly start indices cluster tightly (e.g. SMAP-E channels all flag in rows 5000–5800), strongly suggesting wall-clock alignment. We don't have absolute timestamps to verify, so this is best-effort.
4. **Build the ground truth as the union of per-sensor anomaly ranges.** A row is "anomaly" if any sibling sensor flagged it. Intersection sounds cleaner but is wrong here — different sensors respond on different timescales (voltage drops first, temperature climbs later), so intersection produces an unrealistically narrow, often-empty GT.
5. **Send the 4 channels as 4 variates** in one lens — `csv_configs.data_columns: ["c0", "c1", "c2", "c3"]` with each `cN` being one sibling's `c0` (primary measurement).

**When this beats single-channel + mode flags:**
- Sibling channels diverge during normal operation but synchronize during anomaly (multi-sensor agreement is the signal)
- The anomaly is observable on multiple sensors with different physical principles
- You have substantial held-out normal rows for honest precision (>100)

**When it doesn't:**
- Fewer than 3 truly correlated siblings available (thin KNN library)
- Sibling channels span multiple unrelated incidents — mixing patterns dilutes the n-shot signal
- Anomaly covers >50% of the channel (no held-out normal → degenerate precision)

For groups with >4 sibling channels, combine with the parallel-subsystem pattern: run 3 lenses with disjoint 4-channel subsets and merge their predictions (majority vote or union).

## Honest Held-out Evaluation

When you have labeled ground truth and want to measure precision/recall/F1 — not just produce classifications — the n-shot pattern requires careful splitting so the model never sees the rows it's evaluated on.

### Half-and-half split per anomaly region

For each labeled anomaly range `[a, b]`:
- **First half** `[a, mid)` → feeds the anomaly focus CSV
- **Second half** `[mid, b)` → held out for evaluation

Newton sees the first halves as anomaly examples; the second halves are unseen. Precision/recall on the second halves is the honest number. (Don't hold out whole anomaly regions unless the channel has multiple — you'd lose all training signal for that anomaly *type*.)

### Held-out must exclude *every* row Newton was shown

Common bug: defining `held_out = test_rows MINUS training_ranges` (where training_ranges = first halves of anomalies). This treats the **normal focus source rows** as if they were held out. They're not — Newton saw them. The correct definition:

```
seen_rows       = normal_source_ranges ∪ anomaly_training_ranges
held_out_rows   = test_rows ∖ seen_rows
```

Then `held_out_anomaly_rows = held_out_rows ∩ all_GT_ranges` and `held_out_normal_rows = held_out_rows ∖ all_GT_ranges`. F1 is computed only on `held_out_rows`.

### Multi-segment normal focus

Don't sample normal only from pre-first-anomaly. For long channels with multiple anomaly regions, also sample the **first half of each inter-anomaly gap** and the **first half of the post-last-anomaly tail**. The second halves of those gaps stay in held-out, so evaluation remains honest.

The reason: a channel may have 5,000 rows of normal data, but if your normal focus is only the first 1,000 rows, the encoder learns "normal = early-mission pattern." Later mission phases look different and get false-alarmed even though they're normal. Multi-segment coverage attacks this directly.

```python
def multisegment_normal_ranges(seqs, n_rows, fraction=0.5, min_segment=128):
    ranges = []
    sorted_seqs = sorted(seqs)
    # Pre-anomaly
    if sorted_seqs[0][0] >= min_segment:
        ranges.append([0, sorted_seqs[0][0]])
    # First halves of inter-anomaly gaps
    for i in range(len(sorted_seqs) - 1):
        gap_start, gap_end = sorted_seqs[i][1], sorted_seqs[i + 1][0]
        if gap_end - gap_start >= min_segment:
            ranges.append([gap_start, gap_start + int((gap_end - gap_start) * fraction)])
    # First half of post-last-anomaly tail
    last_end = sorted_seqs[-1][1]
    if n_rows - last_end >= min_segment:
        ranges.append([last_end, last_end + int((n_rows - last_end) * fraction)])
    return ranges
```

## Adaptive Window Sizing

**The window must fit inside the smallest n-shot training chunk.** If `window > min(training_chunk_lengths)`, no embedding in the focus library is "pure anomaly" — every window straddles the chunk boundary into surrounding normal/noise. The result is catastrophic: Newton can't distinguish the classes (we've seen F1=0% on channels where this constraint was violated).

Heuristic:
```python
def adaptive_window(seqs, training_ranges, total_rows):
    min_chunk = min(b - a for a, b in training_ranges)
    # Largest power-of-2 that fits inside the smallest training chunk
    for w in [512, 256, 128, 64, 32]:
        if w <= min_chunk:
            window = w
            break
    # step = window / 8 for 8x overlap; bump step (halve overlap) if predictions
    # would exceed ~500 (runtime cap, since each prediction is 0.5-1s on staging)
    step = max(1, window // 8)
    while ((total_rows - window) // step + 1) > 500 and step < window // 2:
        step *= 2
    return window, step
```

**Why step = window / 8.** Consecutive windows share `window − step` rows. At step = window/8 (87.5% overlap), the embeddings are *meaningfully different* but you get 8 predictions covering each row. Step = 1 (max overlap) costs 8× more inference for no real resolution gain — adjacent windows produce nearly identical embeddings.

## MI-Picked Variates with Constant-Column Filter

When using telemetry + N mode flags as variates (single-channel mode), pick mode flags by **mutual information between flag state and the anomaly label**, computed only over rows Newton will see (no held-out leakage).

### Required filter: drop columns constant in *both* focus files

A column can have nonzero MI by accident — the y-label and x-value happen to covary across the train/normal boundary — even though within each focus file it's constant. Such a column appears as a dead axis in the KNN embedding (no information to discriminate inside either class). Preflight's `constant_columns` check flags these, and you'll lose 10–20pp F1 if you leave them in.

```python
VAR_FLOOR = 1e-6
def is_dead_in_focus(col_values, normal_mask, training_mask):
    v_n = col_values[normal_mask].var()
    v_t = col_values[training_mask].var()
    return v_n < VAR_FLOOR and v_t < VAR_FLOOR
```

**Keep informative asymmetries.** If a column is constant in *one* focus class but varies in the *other*, KEEP it — that asymmetry is exactly what KNN exploits ("this flag fires only during anomaly"). Filtering on "constant in either" is too aggressive and drops your most predictive features.

## Staging Gotchas

### `omega_embeddings_01` may not be available on staging

The production-default model version `OmegaEncoder::omega_embeddings_01` is not always exposed on `api.stage.u1.archetypeai.app`. Symptom: lens registration and session creation both succeed, the session reaches `LensSessionStatus.SESSION_STATUS_RUNNING`, but every inference emits:

```json
{"type": "inference.error",
 "event_data": {"error_messages": ["query_id: session-modify-qry-XXX failed!"]}}
```

The `session-modify-qry-` prefix is Newton's internal naming for *all* lens queries — it does NOT mean a `session.modify` event is broken. Switch the `model_version` to `OmegaEncoder::omega_embeddings_1_4` and it works.

### KNN ranking is non-deterministic under load

Same focus files, same query CSV, same lens config — F1 fluctuates ±10–15pp between runs on staging. Tie-breaking in the KNN library appears load-dependent. Report median over 3+ runs, or move to prod for stable metrics.

### SSE consumer drops mid-stream

The streaming response from `GET /lens/sessions/consumer/{session_id}` sometimes closes before all `inference.result` events are delivered (`httpx.RemoteProtocolError: peer closed connection`). Wrap the consumer loop in `try/except (httpx.RemoteProtocolError, ReadError, ConnectError, ReadTimeout)` and return whatever predictions arrived as a *partial* result — better than losing the full run on a network blip.

### Validate focus CSVs with `omega-1-4-preflight` before paying for inference

The [omega-1-4-preflight](https://github.com/archetypeai/omega-1-4-preflight) static checks (schema / timestamp / constant_columns / feature_scale / n-shot-support / schema_match / class_balance / window-vs-sampling) run in milliseconds against your focus CSVs, no API call. Run them before every classify if you're iterating on focus selection — catches most "0 predictions" mysteries before you spend 90s on a doomed Newton run.

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `window_size` | 16 | Rows per sliding window |
| `step_size` | 8 | Row stride between windows |
| `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` | 300 | Max sensor readings to buffer |
| `MIN_DATA_POINTS` | 20-32 | Minimum points before first query |
| `QUERY_INTERVAL` | 15000ms | Time between periodic queries |

## Best Practices

- **Focus CSV quality matters more than quantity** — 50-200 well-labeled rows per class is sufficient
- **Column names must match** between focus files and query data exactly
- **Reuse sessions** — creating sessions has overhead; create once and query repeatedly
- **Always connect SSE before setting input** — otherwise results may be missed
- **Implement early termination** — avoids 60-80s idle wait per query
- **Graceful degradation** — apps should work without Newton; check availability first
- **Clean up on tab close** (browser-side sessions) — fire `DELETE /lens/sessions/destroy` from a `pagehide` handler with `fetch(..., { keepalive: true })` so orphaned sessions don't accumulate on refresh/close. `navigator.sendBeacon` works too but only sends POSTs.
- **Clean stale lenses on startup** — before registering a new lens, `GET /lens/metadata` and delete any old ones matching your name prefix. Lens registrations persist across sessions and accumulate.
- **Channel-first transpose** — Machine State Lens expects streams as `[[col1 values], [col2 values], ...]`, not row-major. If classifications look random, check this first.

## Building a frontend on top of this

If you're wrapping the Machine State Lens in a React/Svelte/etc. UI — per-stage anomaly dashboard, real-time classification monitor, n-shot replay tool — **read [`DESIGN.md`](../../DESIGN.md) at the root of this repo before writing any CSS**. The Archetype design system (Tailwind v4 + `@archetypeai/ds-lib-tokens` + Geist sans/mono + OKLCH palette + dark-first) is the expected visual language for these demos. [`newton-swat-demo`](https://github.com/archetypeai/newton-swat-demo) is the canonical reference implementation for Machine State (6 parallel SSE sessions, per-stage cards with `good` / `warning` / `critical` Badge variants, mono numeric readouts, sharp 2px radii); [`newton-wifi-demo`](https://github.com/archetypeai/newton-wifi-demo) shows the same patterns applied to a different domain; [`newton-nasa-jpl-telemanom-demo`](https://github.com/archetypeai/newton-nasa-jpl-telemanom-demo) demonstrates honest held-out evaluation on the NASA telemanom benchmark with single-channel (telemetry + MI-picked mode flags) and subsystem (multi-sensor variates with union GT) modes side-by-side, including adaptive window sizing keyed to the smallest n-shot training chunk. Setting this up at the start is much cheaper than retrofitting later.
